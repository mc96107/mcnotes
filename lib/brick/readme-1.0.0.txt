Mozilla Brick

To include Brick in your project, include the bundled stylesheet and script 
files in your project's page like any other CSS/JS file.

To use the provided default font for your components, include the font file in 
the same directory as your Brick stylesheet. 
(If you move the font file elsewhere, look for the "OpenSans-SemiBold.ttf" in 
 the @font-face declaration at the start of the included stylesheet and 
 replace it with the correct path to the file).

Further documentation can be found at http://mozilla.github.io/brick/
